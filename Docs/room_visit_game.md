# Solving Discrete Space problems with PuLP

## Problem Statement:
### The Life Portion Rooms
    There are 4 rooms, which contain Life portions. 
    The life portion obtained at each visit is governed by the formula:
LifePortion(v) = log(v*(\frac{0.42}{i}) + 1) where `i` is the room number, and v is the visit.
 
    Each room can be visited a maximum of 10 times. 
    There is a maximum 100 visits which can be made in total.
    The aim is to collect the maximum amount of life portion in the 100 visits.
